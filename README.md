# roddy-flatpaks
Personal Flatpak Repo

## Add repo
``` bash
flatpak remote-add roddy-flatpak https://kichirouhoshino.github.io/roddy-flatpaks/index.flatpakrepo
```
This repo relies on Flathub for its runtimes.

## Currently serving:
- sh.ppy.osu
- net.badlion.BadlionClient
- com.pixelomer.ShijimaQt
- music.deadbeef.player (Can't build extension yet)

Until I can get my packages to show up in your download managers, you will have to install flatpaks via terminal.
